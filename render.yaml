# Use the official Python image as the base image
# Choose a version that matches your application's runtime
# You can also use your own custom image here
# See https://hub.docker.com/_/python for more options
from: python:3.9-slim

# Add your application code to the image
copy:
  - ./

# Set the working directory to the app directory
workdir: /app

# Install dependencies
# You can also use a requirements.txt file instead
# See https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files for more options
command:
  - apt-get update && apt-get install -y libcairo2-dev
  - pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the application
# This command will vary depending on your application's structure and runtime
# In this example, we assume the main file is named "app.py" and is in the app directory
# You may need to adjust this command for your specific use case
